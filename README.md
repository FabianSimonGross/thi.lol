*It sucks to study in ... Ingolstadt*

_Deutsche Fassung unten_

## Prelude

This is a repository for my personal experiences and experiences of friends and comillitons at the "Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt. 
I am a student of the Bachelor's programm in Computer Science at this explicit University and I am in the students council trying to get things to be better for everyone.
In my studies I - no we've - experienced a lot of things that are not good or downright disappointing with the "Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt" regarding Social Life, Communication, University Policy, IT, Campus, Sustainability and Education, which we want to share publicly on order to extend the information the university publishes.

If you want to broaden this perspective fell free to reach out to me  <trouble--at--thi.lol>
You may also contact me in order to sign this statement (get listed as supporter or critizise this elucidation).

We - in particular I - want to be transparent about this criticism and are actually up for a polite discourse to change the issues.

## Student & Social Life

There are events on the Campus of THI, but they are not well known and not well attended. The events are not well advertised and the students are not well informed about the events. This mostly boils down to:

=> No one knows about the events and no one cares about the events.

Most student clubs are looking forward to the "Erstemestertag", as a first opportunity to make friends and get new active members. 
Durging the semest though, thse (as well as other project / culturaly-active groups) are extremely hard to find, due to their negative experience with organizing events on campus.
Students on the other hand are spending as litte time as possible on campus, either due to their "drive-to-campus -> Lecture -> drive-home" habtit or due to the lac of social interactions.
In both cases, social life of students takes place outside of the campus, which is not a bad thing per se, but it is a bad thing for the university, as it is not able to provide a social environment for the students.

As a kind for result of the previous section, there is hardly any connection between local, german students and the now 18% of international students. 
Imagine this: You are spending months to research a place to study abroad which fits your study/interests/social/housing need in an internationally eligible country.
After arriving and having spent your first few weeks you realize, that the only german people you talk to are lecturers and THI staff. 
It is confusing to hear, that international students in Ingolstadt do meet more other students than germans.

The reason why this problem is mentioned first, is that it is the most persistent and the main source of the following sections - except for the IT & Campus sections. 
It also creats a huge information gap between new students and ones that have already invested a few semesters gaining much implicit information (regarding club-founding, local networks, hot to reach certain professor).
Sometimes it feels like the universty is trying to keep the students from talking to each other, as it is not providing any social environment most of the time.

<summary>Possible Measures</summary>
<br>

1. Create a networking platform, that is organized by e.g. the Student Council and actually support that
2. Integrate the "Campus-Life Newsletter" into the THI Calender in PRIMUSS
3. Increase the transparency and incentives for interaction in student clubs, via a public, uniform guideline regarding:
    - Do not be hostile to student clubs, these are a huge part of the social life on campus and are not a threat to the university but sometimes the university forgets that people do this in their time off
    - As an incentive to interact and do something inside the student clubs would a uniform social credit system as in the business school be a good way forth
4. Communicate Rights and habits of existing clubs (more club rooms in W-Building less workers of institues there, distribution list for club chairs)
5. How to use/reserve THI rooms for events and really reserve them.
6. The communication channels between clubs, the student council and the university management especially the leadership

## Communication

### to the Students

The communication between the university and the students is not good. The university is not able to communicate important information to the students. 
This is mostly due to the fact, that the university is only sending information via email and the students are not reading their emails.

Well why?

Easy explanation: The students are not reading a billion mails a day! The information should be centralized and uniform communicated. 
As an example: While other universties work with newsletters for (e.g.: new students, cultural activies, events, careeer and startup, and so on...) we get an email for every single THING except for the campus life newsletter which is managed by the student council.

An usual Mailbox in a week of a student looks like this:

- a few mails per week from student clubs
  - heres the campus life newsletter
  - maximum of 5 mails per week of the clubs
    - clubs have set themselves a limit of 2 mails per club per term
    - still there are bascially 16 clubs that all compete for students there are about 15 Weeks in a term
- mails from your courses
  - automatic mails from the moodle system of each course
  - Mails from your lecturer about something organizational
- automatic mails
  - since the last moodle update an information of login (each single time!)

*AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST*
- .GR-STUD-Informationen
This is a unspecified mailing list for unspecified information. And it is used to send out bascially EVERYTHING!
Here you get information about going abroad, or the library, or the career service, or the center of entrepreneurship, or ... you get the point?
- .GR-STUD-UMFRAGEN
This is only a specific mailing list for only surveys and boy do they clutter your mailbox!

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>


*N E W S L E T T E R S*

Plain out: Create the following newsletters and you're good to go:

1. erstis/ruckies (students in their first semester) 
   - once per month should be enough to get them to understand the university
2. culture (events, cultural activities, ...)
   - once a month should be enough to get this elevated to the students
   - here you have place for the On Campus Festival, Theater of Ingolstadt, ... 
3. career (career service, center of entrepreneurship ...)
   - you might wanna do that twice a month (bi-weekly) because thats an ever changing field
   - here you have place for CV-Workshops, Startup-Weekends, Gründerpreis, ...
4. international (for international students)
   - this you might also do twice a month (bi-weekly) because international students need more information than the others
   - here you have place for the international office, the buddy program of N.I.C.E, Information that might be needed by international students ...
5. campus life (for all students)
   - per week basis
   - this is already established you don't really need to change a log here
6. library (for all students)
   - once a month should be enough
   - here you elevate information about 24/7 opening times, new books, troubles with the library system, ...
7. surveys!!!!
   - twice a month (bi-weekly) should be enough and fast enough to get the students to answer. No need for sometimes 3 mails a day!
   - this is the most vital part of the whole thing. You need to create a mailing list for surveys and only surveys.

Of course you can't do everything via Newsletters because some things are vitally important and need to be communicated fast. But you can reduce the amount of mails to the students by a lot.

### between facultys

Well, how to put it? Everyone is cooking their own soup. There is no communication between the facultys.

For me especially as a member of the student council it is really obvious, that there is no communication between the facultys. For students itself it might not be that obvious, but it is still there.
While one faculty has for round-tables with the students per year a guideline the other does not, one faculty includes their specific board of students to round-tables the other does not... and so on and so forth.

There should be knowledge transfer between the facultys. The facultys should work together and not against each other which is also a problem in the quality of teaching (more on that later)

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Establish a guideline for working with the students
2. Establish a guideline for the communication between the facultys
3. Establish a seating once per term to exchange knowledge between the facultys
4. Establish mythi for the lecturers and employees as as means of communication and knowledege transfer.
   
</details>

### between departments

Specific to the employees of the university. There is a lack of knowledge on the side of the employees.
This is due to the fact, that the facultys, employees and the university management are not communicating with each other properly.

An employee in the service center for student affairs needs to know how each faculty works, what the rules are and how to handle the students.
This is proper hard, because as mentioned in the above section everyone is cooking their own soup.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Give employees the possibility to get to know the other departments, the other facultys and the university management.
2. It is hard for the employees know everything, so give them a possibility to get the information they need fast and easy.
3. Establish mythi for the employees as as means of communication and knowledege transfer.

## University Policy

Oh boy, this is going to be annoying.

Most university policies are fine. But there are some that are just plain out not good or are not kept to their word.
I do understand that we have quality management regulations those and that they are important. But since they are new basically no one checks if they are kept to their word.

---

Let's start from the course and teaching evaluation:
1. has to happen every time a course is held (but at latest at the third time)
2. has to happen at the call of students (not defined how many students)
3. there have to be given at least 15 minutes **in** the course to complete the evaluation
4. there has to be a discussion of the results before **the last** day the course is held in a term

**Well, let's see how this is kept to their word:**

_Point 1:_

This is pretty much kept to their word, so no problem here.

_Point 2:_

This is not kept to their word. The students have to call for the evaluation, but we have had a few reluctant lecturers who did not want to do the evaluation. So this is not kept to their word.

_Point 3:_

This is not kept to their word. There are a few lecturers who do not give the students the time to complete the evaluation in the course. 
They give the students the time to complete the evaluation, but not in the course. So this is not kept to their word.

_Point 4:_

This is partially kept to their word. There are a few lecturers who do only defend their stance of lecturing and basically ignore the constructive feedback in the evaluation. So this is not kept to their word.

---

Okay so far so good. Let's go to the next one - Talks with the student council:
1. has to happen once a term
2. has to be with members of the student council and the university management as well as the vice president for teaching and studies and the quality management officer
3. has to be documented and made available to to all participants

**How does this work out?**

Point 1 and 2:

This is not kept to their word. We are close to the end of the term and we have not had a single talk with all participants. 
We have had talks with the university management and one with the vice president for teaching and studies, but not with all participants in one room
We do not count the "Lenkungskreis Systemakkreditierung" or the "Akkreditierungskommission"! These are not the above mentioned talks.

Point 3:
- All of the above mentioned talks have not been officially documented only by the participants of the student council.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Teach your teachers why it is important to do the evaluation and how to do it properly
2. Teach your teachers how to handle constructive feedback
3. Teach your teachers how to handle the evaluation in general
4. Keep to your word and do the talks with the student council and document them properly

</details>

### Self-criticism skills of the university and the facultys

As member of student council we do ask for different things that might or might not make life easier for students.
We do ask for things to make that quality of teaching better. There we usually get good feedback, but sometimes we get the answer "We are doing everything right, we do not need to change anything".

At the same time we get feedback from students that the quality of teaching is not good and that they do not feel like they are learning anything.

_Short digression:_ In general in the times of ChatGPT and the like it would be nessesary to change the way of teaching to be more competence oriented and not knowledge oriented.
The problem here lies in the exams. These are in the end pure bulk learning of pure ínformation and vomitting it out in the exam.

But back to self-criticism, the faculty of electrical engineering is one of the worst offenders here. 
They do not want to change anything and they do not want to hear complaints about the structure of the degree programs, the quality of teaching and the like.
There has been an instance in this particular faculty where a whole group of students in the bachelors degree programm "Electrical Engineering and Electric Mobility" have been ignored while they did a degree programm revision. 
The critique of the students at the time was that the degree programm was bascially an extension of the degree programm "Electrical Engineering and Information Technology" and that there was no real difference between the two.

The students have been ignored and the degree programm has been approved by the university management, even though the students in the specific boards mentioned that there was dissent in the degree programm revision.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Listen to feedback from students and the student council
2. Do not ignore the feedback from students and the student council
3. Do not ignore dissent in the degree programm revision
4. Be open for change, especially as a university with research as one of the main goals

## Accessibility and Inclusion

The lack of accessibility of PDF documents on a university's website and the inadequate construction standards pose a significant barrier for people with disabilities. 
By not publishing its PDF's in an accessible manner, the university excludes visually impaired or blind students from using this information independently. 
This is contrary to the principles of inclusion and equal opportunity that a university should normally promote.

In addition, the door steps in the buildings, some of which are too high, are another problem. 
These make it difficult or even impossible for wheelchair users and people with mobility impairments to enter the premises or move freely within them. 
Especially when a university has been awarded the "Bavaria barrier-free" signet, it is disappointing that the building conditions do not meet the expected standards.

It is important that universities ensure that their sites and buildings are accessible to all people, regardless of their individual needs and abilities. 
This requires providing accessible PDF documents and creating a built environment that allows full access for people with disabilities. 
Only then can all students be given equal opportunities and realize their full potential.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Make all PDF documents accessible
2. Make all buildings accessible
3. Make all websites accessible
4. Teach students and staff how to make accessible documents and websites

</details>

## IT Infrastructure

I do hate to say it but my data doesn't feel safe here. I do not trust the IT Infrastructure of the university due to the lack of self-criticism and proper appointment of resources to needed projects.

One of the largest examples is the THI-App, the THI-App 2.0 and everything regarding Apps in general. Short explanation your account data can be stolen if you are not in a closed Network. 
This vunerability has been fixed for Android Users in the origianl app.  And the THI-APP 2.0 reimplemented this vunerability again. So you are not safe using any of the official apps.

I'm gonna quote a student club here:
>Be aware that simply opening a vulnerable version of the app when connected to an untrusted Wi-Fi network may compromise your university account.
>
> Neuland Ingolstadt e.V. (2021)

The same student club also providdes an alternative with the neuland.app, which is open source and does not have the vunerability furthermore this app is designed with students in mind.
In discussions with the university management, it was not possible to come to an agreement to regognize the app of the club as official and simply discontinuing any other app.
This wouldn't be a problem if the university would actually invest in this particular project, but they do not. They do not even give the club the needed resources to make the app better.

Another side note have been the SSL-Certificates in 2023 they came to an end and the university did not have an automatic renewal of the certificates. So the website of the university was not reachable for a few days.
The same happened for the Backend of the Apps therefore also these have not been reachable for a few days.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Invest in the neuland.app and make it the official app of the university
2. Build a project in the degree programms "Computer Science" and "User Experience Design" to have students work on the app also going forward
3. Do not ignore the vunerabilities in the IT Infrastructure
4. Automate the renewal of the SSL-Certificates

## Buildings of the University

Nice looking buildings you got there Ingolstadt! But oh boy they all do have their problems.

Lets go through them one by one:

- Building A

One deficiency concerns Building A, specifically the glass ceiling of the hall, which is leaking. 
It is extremely troubling that such a central space on campus is prone to water intrusion. 
A leaking glass ceiling indicates poor construction and lack of maintenance. 
Not only does the leaking ceiling pose a safety hazard, but it can also cause significant damage to the building fabric and interior finishes. 
It is imperative that the leaking glass ceiling be repaired as soon as possible to prevent further water intrusion and restore the functionality and safety of the hall.

- Building D

Another deficiency concerns Building D, which becomes unbearably hot in the summer. 
It is extremely frustrating and unacceptable for a building on the university campus to have such high temperatures that significantly affect learning and working comfort. 
This indicates poor building insulation, inefficient air conditioning systems, or inadequate facade design. 
It is critical that appropriate measures be taken to reduce the indoor temperature in this building to an acceptable level and create a comfortable learning and working environment.

- Building F

Building F has an extremely worrisome problem: The ceiling is sagging. 
This is not only a clear sign of poor construction, but also a serious safety hazard. 
It is unacceptable that a building frequented by students and staff should have such structural problems. 
Urgent action is needed to correct this problem and ensure the safety of all users.

- Building G

With regard to Building G, it is extremely regrettable that the courtyard cannot be accessed, as the structural design of the windows allegedly does not allow this. 
This suggests that care was not taken in the design and construction of the building structure. 
A courtyard should be an integral part of campus life, serving as a social gathering and recreational area for students and staff. 
It is imperative that solutions be found to make the courtyard safe and functional without compromising the integrity of the building structure.

- Building K

Building K, which is considered brand new, was supposed to be a prime example of modern design and timely completion. 
However, it is extremely disappointing to find that it is still a construction site. 
This raises questions about project management and construction oversight. 
It appears that there are significant delays and difficulties in completing the building, which is affecting the reputation of the college and disrupting the learning environment for students. 
It is of utmost importance that all necessary measures are taken to ensure that Building K is completed as soon as possible to serve its intended purpose and provide adequate facilities for students.

- Building W (Container)

As far as Building W is concerned, it is extremely regrettable that a container building at the end of its life still houses rooms unsuitable for students while staff of an institute are housed in it. 
This shows a clear lack of resource and space planning on the part of the university. 
Students should have adequate spaces to learn and develop, while staff should have appropriate workspaces. 
There is an urgent need to find alternative solutions to both meet the needs of students and provide adequate working conditions for staff.

---
<details>
<summary>Possible Measures</summary>

1. Invest money in the maintenance of the buildings
2. Ignore the "nice to have" and focus on the "need to have"
3. Maybe even invest in some space for the students to relax and have a good time (e.g. Sofa, Table Tennis, etc.)

</details>

## Miscellaneous points

- Mentally un-stable person feel left alone (and therefore encouraged to drop out)
- Stone pavement of the campus (bad for accessibility and transporting things, water run-off, heat storage tank)
- Library is waaaay to small
- Other universities offer instant messaging in their intranet portal, which leads to more usage of any university websites.
- Speaking of other universities:
Why are there no signs directing to the individual buildings by name/faculty?
